\section{Introduction}

\textcolor{red}{UPDATE ME!}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Paragraph on PM, impact on human health etc. 
    \item Note the EPA's new guidelines, limitations of 8 hr, 24 hr, and annual averages. Cite work linking cognitive performance to PM exposure (e.g. Shawhin's paper and other work).
    \item Paragraph on existing (mechanistic) models for PM, e.g. chemical transport models (see dissertation)
    \item Paragraph on prior ML attempts for PM estimates/forecasts  (include Prabuddha's paper) --> motivate need for \textit{interpretable} models that can extract short term PM spikes
    \item Introduce HAVOK model from Brunton et al. and subsequent update for sHAVOK
    \item ...In this paper, we apply HAVOK to model PM, etc... Additionally, we demonstrate how the method can be augmented to facilitate short-term forecasts. The learned forcing function can be used
    \item Overview of paper structure...

\section{Discussion}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Describe relevance to low-cost PM monitoring
    \item Potential applications: short term forecasts (using lower time resolution to obtain 1-6 hr forecasts)
    \item Potential applications: multiple size distributions
    \item Potential applications: outlier detection
